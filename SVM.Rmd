```{r}
heart <- read.csv('http://bit.ly/HeartdiseaseDataset', sep = ',', header = FALSE)
head(heart)
```


We check the structure of the dataframe through the function str()
```{r}
str(heart)
```
Next we split the data into training set and testing set.
The “y” parameter takes the value of variable according to which data needs to be partitioned. 
In our case, target variable is at V14, so we are passing heart$V14
The “p” parameter holds a decimal value in the range of 0-1. It’s to show the percentage of the split. 
We are using p=0.7. It means that data split should be done in 70:30 ratio. 
So, 70% of the data is used for training and the remaining 30% is for testing the model.
The “list” parameter is for whether to return a list or matrix. 
We are passing FALSE for not returning a list

```{r}
intrain <- createDataPartition(y = heart$V14, p= 0.7, list = FALSE)
training <- heart[intrain,]
testing <- heart[-intrain,]
```
We check the dimensions of out training dataframe and testing dataframe

```{r}
dim(training); 
dim(testing);
```


We then clean the data using the anyNA() method that checks for any null values.

```{r}
anyNA(heart)
```

Then check the summary of our data by using the summary() function


```{r}
summary(heart)
```

From our output above, we can see that the values of the various variables are not standardized. 
For example, the V14 variables, which is our target variable, it holds only 2 values, either 0 or 1.
This should be a categorical variable. To convert these to categorical variables, we need to factorize them.
The following code will convert the training data frame’s “V14” column to a factor variable.
```{r}

training[["V14"]] = factor(training[["V14"]])
training[["V14"]]
```
